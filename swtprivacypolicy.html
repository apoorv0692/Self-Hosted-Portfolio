In Smart Weight tracker, we only store your First name along with your weight only when you interact with Smart weight tracker on your google home device and logs your weight.

<p><b>How do we use the information?</b></br>
When a user triggers the action and asks Smart weight tracker to log weight, the user's first name, and weight are requested from the user and are store along with the current date when it was logged. This information is used only when the user requests a log entry or asks the action to compare data for determining if they have lost or gained weight.

<b>What information do we share?</b></br>
"NONE". As this google home action is made only for personal use (tracking weight changes using voice commands), none of this information will ever be shared or 
used for any other purpose.</br>

In the next phase of actions, users will be able to request google home to purge all their data</br> -->
